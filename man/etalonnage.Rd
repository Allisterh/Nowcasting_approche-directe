\arguments{
\item{name}{A character indicating a name for the analysis.}

\item{X}{A tibble/df containing the regressors. Must contain a date column.}

\item{y}{A vector containing the target variable.}

\item{forecast_origin}{A character indicating the first forecast origin, it
must be of the form \code{"YYYY-MM-01"}.}

\item{regressor}{A character. For now, only \code{"randomForest"}, \code{"xgboost"}
\code{"glmnet"} and \code{"lm"} are accepted.}

\item{cols}{A vector of characters indicating columns to extend. Series
are extended with an ARIMA(p,d,q) model - if missing defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{scale}{Indicates  whether to leave unchanged, center or scale \code{X}.
Must be one of \verb{"none}, \code{"center"} or \code{"scale"}.}

\item{frequency}{A character indicating the date frequency - if missing
defaults to \code{"quarter"}.}

\item{seed}{A numeric value interpreted as an integer.}

\item{...}{Aditionnal arguments to pass to the regressor.}

\value{
An object from S3 class \code{etalonnage}.

\description{
To train and evaluate the models, a rolling-origin-update evaluation (ROUE)
is implemented, meaning that the forecast origin rolls ahead in time.
At each step, ROUE increments the traning set by one observation of the test
set. The date of the first sample to predict is given by \code{forecast_origin}
plus 1 quarter. Note that the training set always starts at the first sample
of \code{X}.
To take into account the non-synchronicity of data publications, use the
\code{cols} argument to indicate which series need to be extended. In this way
the forecast accuracy can be assessed on the basis of a pseudo real-time
experiment i.e. replicating the timeliness of the releases of the series
by taking into account their publications lags. This ensures to consider
only those values of the series that would have been available on the date
on which the forecasts were calculated.
